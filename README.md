## 9. Testing

### Unit Tests (JUnit)

    Unit tests are located in the src/test/java directory.
    Run tests using your IDE or mvn test command.

### Integration Tests (RestAssured)

    Integration tests are located in the src/test/java directory.
    Run tests using your IDE or mvn verify command.

## 10. Deployment

    Deploy the application to your preferred environment (local, cloud, etc.).
    Ensure proper configuration for the deployment environment.

## 11. Some problems during project
<div class="wrap-text">
    Vin crc verification. There is no only one crc algorithm for Vin number. Most comapany has them own crc algorithm. The most popular is Luna10 
    (inculde weight multiply system and modulo divide by 11 method).
</div>

## 12. Troubleshooting

  ### 1. Application Fails to Start

Issue: The application fails to start, and an error message is displayed.

Solution:
<div class="wrap-text">
    Check if all required dependencies are installed and configured correctly.
    Verify that the database connection settings in application.properties are accurate.
    Review the application logs for detailed error messages to pinpoint the issue.
</div>
 
 ### 2. Unable to Authenticate

Issue: Users are unable to authenticate and receive errors when attempting to log in.
